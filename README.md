## About

A collection of small sketches put together in the [Processing](http://www.processing.org) environment.

## How to view

In order to run the sketches, you will need to download and install [Processing](http://www.processing.org).

To open a sketch in Processing, go to File > Open. Select the directory containing the project you wish to open, and open the .pde file that has the same name as the directory.

## Sketches

### Attraction

Particles swarm around the canvas and are attracted to/repelled from one another, creating interesting patterns that vary as you tweak the parameters in the attractive and repulsive forces.

### Cycloids

Visualization of the lines traced out by a point on a circle rotating along a bigger circle's circumference.

### Matrix Compression

Simple projection of an image's grayscale values onto a subspace, used as an inefficient and very lossy compression algorithm.
